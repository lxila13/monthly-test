            <p4>Who can forget the thrills and excitement of last year's mini olympics? Certainly not us.

The event kicked off with a grand opening ceremony, which</p4>
            <p5>included live music and action. All of the schools marched around the track in their teams with their banners. The torch was lit and the olympics were declared open. The atmosphere was electrifying.
              
                Can we beat it this year? Oh yes we can.
                
                This year the live music will be provided by none other than the well-known JK Band.
                
                The opening ceremony will be 2 hours long and the torch bearer will be selected at random from the entrants.
                
                The closing ceremony will take place on day 7. This will include the presentation of all medals, live music and dance routines.</p5>
